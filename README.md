# tarot

## Description

Simple model of a French tarot card game written in Rust. Basic game rules are respected but IA is crappy for the moment (just plays any valid card in its hand at each round).

## Installation and usage

Install the [Rust environment](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html) and follow the instructions.

Then at the project root just enter in your terminal:
```
cargo run
```
